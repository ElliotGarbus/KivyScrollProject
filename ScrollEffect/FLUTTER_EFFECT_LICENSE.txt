Flutter-Inspired Scroll Effect for Kivy
========================================

This file clarifies the licensing for flutter_scroll_effect.py

COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE
---------------------

The flutter_scroll_effect.py implementation is original work that may be
distributed under the same terms as Kivy (MIT License).

No source code was copied from Flutter, iOS, WebKit, or any other project.
This is a clean-room implementation based on understanding publicly documented
algorithms and standard physics principles.


WHAT IS NOT COPYRIGHTABLE
--------------------------

This implementation uses the following, which are NOT subject to copyright:

1. Mathematical Formulas:
   - Critical damping: c = 2√(km)
   - Spring force: F = -kx (Hooke's Law, 1660)
   - Damping force: F = -cv
   - Logarithmic function: (1.0 - (1.0 / ((x * coeff / dim) + 1.0))) * dim

2. Physics Concepts:
   - Mass-spring-damper systems (classical mechanics)
   - Critical damping (control theory)
   - Exponential decay
   - Newton's laws of motion

3. Algorithms:
   - Semi-implicit Euler integration (numerical methods)
   - Spring simulation (standard physics)


ATTRIBUTION
-----------

This implementation was inspired by studying the behavior of:

1. ✅ You may use this code - it's compatible with commercial use
2. ✅ Keep the attribution comments in the source file
3. ✅ Include this license file in your distribution
4. ✅ Comply with Kivy's MIT License terms
5. ✅ Consider consulting a lawyer if you have specific concerns


SUMMARY
-------

✅ Safe to use in open source projects
✅ Safe to use in commercial projects
✅ Safe to modify and extend
✅ No code copied from other projects
✅ Based on public domain physics and mathematics
✅ Compatible with MIT License (Kivy)
✅ Compatible with BSD 3-Clause License (Flutter)
